Details of the dataset (from section 3.1 of paper):

Our dataset consisted of student responses to problem sets that satisfied the following constraints:
- Items in the problem set must have been given in a random order
- A student must have answered all items in the problem set in one day
- There are at least four items in the problem set of the exact same skill tagging
- Data is from The ASSISTment System gathered from Fall 2008 to Spring 2010

Filename convention example: G4.225-exact.txt
- 'G' is for GLOP which means Groups of Learning OPportunities
- '4' indicates the number of items in the problem set
- '225' is the GLOP id of the problem set
- '-exact' specifies that the items in the problem set all have the exact same skill tagging.
   all the problem sets in this dataset are of type -exact although we have a dataset
   with more problem sets that relaxes this contraint.

Data column description: user_id response_1 response_2 ... response_N
- 0 corresponds to an incorrect first attmpet of the main problem, 1 is a correct first attempt
- responses of a student are in chronological order
- each student complted an average of 3 of the 42 problem sets in this dataset
- each problem set has on average of 312 students
